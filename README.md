                     This application is different from other recipe applications because of the intended search system. Not only can a user search for a specific dish by name to obtain it's recipe, users may input the supplies, utensils and cooking equipment (such as an oven) using check boxes to view the various dishes that are possible, where the default view will be in a descending order of upvotes . Users can add recipes which strike their fancy or variations in pre-existing recipes as new entries after creating a handle connected to their email ids or social media accounts. This ensures that the application never stops improving itself.
