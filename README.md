	New app to cook your fav dish instantly.

In this period of unease when people are looking for various hobbies to distract themselves from the tensions of daily life during a pandemic, anybody with a social media account can observe the increase in the number of people dabbling in the culinary arts. The application that we would like to present seeks to encourage and simplify such endeavours. Moreover, even after this era of the pandemic, this application's relevance does not fade away with time. 
This application is different from other recipe applications because of the intended search system. Not only can a user search for a specific dish by name to obtain it's recipe, users may input the supplies, utensils and cooking equipment (such as an oven) using check boxes to view the various dishes that are possible, where the default view will be in a descending order of upvotes . Users can add recipes which strike their fancy or variations in pre-existing recipes as new entries after creating a handle connected to their email ids or social media accounts. This ensures that the application never stops improving itself.
